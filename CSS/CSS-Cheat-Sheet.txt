Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter.


.class -> select element with same class
#id -> select element with unique id
* -> select all
element -> select an element
element1, element2 -> select multiple elements
element1 element2 -> select all element2 inside element1
element1 > element2 -> select all element2 that have parent of element1
element1 + element2 -> select any element2 that is exactly after element1
:hover -> change the style when mouse hovers on it
:last-child -> change the style only on the last child
:first-child -> change the style only on the first child
!important (not recommended) -> override any cascade rules of the element


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity -> more specific something is, the more likely it will win out
-Importance
-Source Order -> if there is two style sheets, then the later style sheet will win out
